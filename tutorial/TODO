* have a side page to talk about why you need the beginPath() and closePath()
* explain why/that we're using jQuery
* provide a link for what setInterval(...) is
  * I should liberally scatter links about topics I introduce but don't
    explain
* need an intro page explaining how the tut works
  * would sidebars underneath the canvas (in light yellow, maybe?)
    be a good way to introduce such things?
  * need to explain that basic familiarity with programming/javascript
    are assumed
* change the color page to use bright breakout colors
* style the header and footer
* verify that all code uses 2-space tabs
* add a "show library" button
* run spellcheck when finished
* make sure all variables are declared "var"
* remove all tabs (wtf is vim doing?)
* update all <, >, and & to escaped versions

Qs:
* how to have slide titles?
* where should the draw() button be? top or bottom? keyboard shortcut?
* add an abort() button?
* when/ever to talk about the stack nature of canvas?
