* have a side page to talk about why you need the beginPath() and closePath()
* explain why/that we're using jQuery
* talk about functions? set up a basic library?
* provide a link for what setInterval(...) is
* need an intro page explaining how the tut works
    *  would sidebars underneath the canvas (in light yellow, maybe?)
       be a good way to introduce such things?
