* have a side page to talk about why you need the beginPath() and closePath()
* explain why/that we're using jQuery
* talk about functions? set up a basic library?
* provide a link for what setInterval(...) is
  * I should liberally scatter links about topics I introduce but don't
    explain
* need an intro page explaining how the tut works
  * would sidebars underneath the canvas (in light yellow, maybe?)
    be a good way to introduce such things?
  * need to explain that basic familiarity with programming/javascript
    are assumed
* change the color page to use bright breakout colors
* when/ever to talk about the stack nature of canvas?
* style the header and footer
* change all code to 2-space tabs (or change indenter to 4-space tabs?)
* make slide titles
* add a "show library" button
* add an abort() button (or not?)
* where should the draw() button be? top or bottom? keyboard shortcut?
* run spellcheck when finish
* on the "else you lose" bit, just clearInterval. Save the interval for
  this purpose
